The theme of my game is to go into each of the different rooms and get items for your boss. The game consists of 8 rooms. You must go through some rooms to get to other rooms. The villain in my game is ‘The Boss’. The area in which you will start your game is the ‘Lobby’. These are the rooms: [Lobby, Boss Office, Server Room, File Room, Closet, My Office, Conference Room, Break Room]. Your boss wants you to obtain all 6 items and return them or else YOU’RE FIRED! 

SCENARIO
You work for a small company that creates text-based games. You recently pitched your design ideas for a text-based adventure game to your team. Your team was impressed by all of your designs, and would like you to develop the game! You will be able to use the map and the pseudocode or flowcharts from your designs to help you develop the code for the game. In your code, you have been asked to include clear naming conventions for functions, variables, and so on, along with in-line comments. Not only will these help you keep track as you develop, but they will help your team read and understand your code. This will make it easier to adapt for other games in the future.
